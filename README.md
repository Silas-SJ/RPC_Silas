# How to find the dataset?
After loggin into your lxplus account you can find the dataset here:

/eos/cms/store/group/dpg_muon/MuonDPGNtuples/validation//MuDPGNtuple_nanoAOD_Run2033A_Express_900GeV_20230419.root

# How to run this analysis code?
.L RPC_Analyzer.C

RPC_Analyzer()

# What is the out put?
After running this analysis you can see a dataset output called "RPC_out.root". Here you will find all histograms created in analysis code "RPC_Analyzer.C". You may also find some histograms in png format.

#additional information

The run number associated with this dataset is 366035 and the corresponding energy is 900GeV.
Both RecHit and clustersize histograms are associated with muons.
